# Create your Image Service by UpIC & GitHub

### For what?

I assume you are a software engineer like to write blogs with a great deal of picture, but you don't know where to store your pictures
to use them easily. You want to access the pictures through your blogs as fast as you can, you are finding the solutions.

Now you have these options => ***but***:

1. Upload them with your blogs together => ***make your folder heavy***
1. Upload them to some other image service => ***tedious, someday could not access***

### A better way to store your public pictures

Hey man, you are a software engineer! Why not use GitHub to store your pictures? It's free! And you can use cdn to view it:
`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{YourName}/{YourRepo}@{Branch}/{folder}/{filename}`

Like this: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Fatezhang/FigureCloud@master/uPic/happy.gif`

![Happy](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Fatezhang/FigureCloud@master/uPic/happy.gif)
